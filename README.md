# 🔐 Python Password Generator

A simple password generator built using **pure Python**.

This repository contains two versions:

- ✅ **Basic Password Generator** (Completed)
- 🚧 **Advanced Password Generator** (In Progress)

This project was created to strengthen Python fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, functions, and randomization.

## 📌 Project Overview

### 1️⃣ Basic Password Generator (Completed)

The basic version:

- Generates random passwords
- Allows user-defined password length
- Uses letters, numbers, and special characters
- Runs in the terminal
- Requires no external libraries

---

### 2️⃣ Advanced Password Generator (Work in Progress)

Planned features:

- Custom selection options:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Symbols
- Password strength indicator
- Option to exclude similar characters (O, 0, l, 1)
- Multiple password generation
- Improved input validation
- Cleaner structured code

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- Built-in modules:
  - `random`
  - `string`

No third-party libraries required.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed.

Run the basic version:

```
python passbasic.py
```

Run the advanced version (once completed):

```
python passadv.py
```

## ⚙️ How the Basic Version Works

1. User enters desired password length.
2. The script creates a character pool using:
   - Letters (A–Z, a–z)
   - Digits (0–9)
   - Special symbols
3. Random characters are selected.
4. The final password is displayed in the terminal.
